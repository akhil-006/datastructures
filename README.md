# datastructures
datastructures such as linked list, trees, graphs etc
Made a public repository for coding enthusiasts. Those who want to collaborate on learning and building data structures can clone this repo and can start working on them.
As an example I have implemented LinkedList(work is still in progress), you can take reference from this and start building your data-structures.
